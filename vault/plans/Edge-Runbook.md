# StewardMD Edge: owner runbook (sprint days 2 to 5)

Plan: [[Edge-Master-Plan]] (gates A0, section 7 pass marks, section 16 sprint). Module: [[StewardMD Edge]].
Everything here needs a Mac, a phone, an account or a doctor. Claude's side (JS, dataset, scorer,
plugin source) is done and tested in Node and headless Chrome. **Nothing native has been built
or run on a device yet**: each gate below is the first real test of that part.

Rules that still hold: flag `smd_edge` stays OFF by default; no patient data anywhere in training;
a failed gate drops that model from v1, it is not worked around.

## 0. Setup (once)
```sh
git checkout ccr-fbfae7e0-rjkxxk && npm install
node scripts/edge/generate.mjs     # ~3 min; train/val + checks the frozen test hash
node scripts/edge/export.mjs       # dataset/export/{cactus,needle-local,llama-json,bakeoff}
node scripts/edge/score.mjs        # baselines; must print rules PASS before anything else
```
If `generate.mjs` changes `test.jsonl`, stop: the frozen test set moved (`npm test` also fails
`edge-dataset.test.mjs`). That needs a new `schema_version`, not a silent overwrite.

## 1. Gate A0.1: 16 KB pages (Android)
**Build half PASSED in the cloud container (2026-10-01):** NDK r27.2 + AGP 8.13 built both plugin
modules against Capacitor core. `libneedle_jni.so` and `libllama_jni.so`: every LOAD segment `0x4000`;
the five Needle JNI exports and `LlamaNative_setGrammar` present; no socket/HTTP/TLS symbols in the
Needle `.so`; the AAR manifest declares `NeedleService` in `:edge`. Still open: steps 3 and 4 below
on the full APK, and the run on an Android 15 16 KB emulator and the phone (no KVM in the container).

1. `cd local-plugins/capacitor-needle && scripts/fetch-needle.sh` (fails loudly on a hash change).
2. Add `"@stewardmd/capacitor-needle": "file:local-plugins/capacitor-needle"` to `package.json`,
   `npm install && npm run sync`, build a debug APK.
3. `unzip -o app-debug.apk 'lib/arm64-v8a/libneedle_jni.so' -d /tmp/apk && readelf -lW /tmp/apk/lib/arm64-v8a/libneedle_jni.so | grep LOAD`
   Every LOAD line must show `0x4000` alignment.
4. Run step 3 of gate A0.2 on an **Android 15 emulator with the 16 KB system image** and on the
   real 4 GB phone. Pass = load and one call succeed on both.
Fail: report to Cactus, drop Needle from v1, FunctionGemma alone goes forward.

## 2. Gate A0.2: process isolation (Android) / serial queue (iOS)
1. Copy weights (README of the plugin: `run-as ... files/needle/needle3.cact`). Base model is fine here.
2. Open the app, attach CDP (`adb shell pidof in.stewardmd.app`, then
   `adb forward tcp:9333 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>`).
3. `node test/edge-bakeoff-device.mjs --engine needle --limit 20`: 20 lines, statuses `ok`.
4. `adb shell ps -A | grep in.stewardmd.app` shows a separate `in.stewardmd.app:edge` process.
5. Kill test: during a run, `adb shell kill -9 <edge pid>`; the app must stay up, the run must
   continue with `error`/`timeout` lines, then recover to `ok` after the next cold load.
iOS: `scripts/make-xcframework.sh`, build, same step 3 through `ios_webkit_debug_proxy` (`--ios --ws`).
iOS has no kill: confirm a long call shows `busy` and then recovers, and the app never freezes.

## 3. Gate A0.3: FunctionGemma + grammar (llama.cpp)
**Mechanism PASSED on a host CPU (2026-10-01, `test/native-host/run.sh llama`):** the real
`llama_jni.cpp` + `LlamaEngine` with ggml-org FunctionGemma 270M Q8_0 (rev 2566ce14, sha256 83940d4d):
grammar on, 1,512/1,512 replies valid `{"option":n}`; grammar off, 0/60 (prose refusals). Base model
routing: 7.7% wrong overall, 20.8% on model-routed rows, so fine-tuning is required. Still open: steps
1 to 3 on the phone (real latency and memory), the template check (step 4) and the GGUF pipeline (step 5).

The llama plugin now takes an opt-in `grammar` (GBNF, root `root`) on both platforms
(`local-plugins/capacitor-llama`, C++ syntax-checked against the pinned prism-b10685 headers,
Java engine compiled; not built for a device). With no grammar nothing changes.
1. Build the app with this branch; confirm a normal MaiK local answer still works (regression).
2. Base FunctionGemma GGUF on the phone; `node test/edge-bakeoff-device.mjs --engine llama --model <gguf path> --limit 20`.
   Every line must be `ok` with an integer `option`; the grammar admits nothing else.
3. **Relaunch the app afterwards**: the llama plugin holds one model and MaiK's pack was evicted.
4. Confirm FunctionGemma's chat template before training: `scripts/edge/export.mjs` writes
   `llama-json` as plain system/user/assistant turns with `{"option":n}`; if FunctionGemma expects
   its own function-calling format, change the exporter first (one function, the tests cover it).
5. Pipeline proof: a tiny fine-tune (any 50 rows), convert with llama.cpp `convert_hf_to_gguf.py`,
   quantise with `llama-quantize` to Q8_0 and Q4_K_M, load both on the phone.

## 4. Gate A0.6: sustained load (4 GB phone, each model)
`--limit 50` back to back, then a 30-minute mixed session (MaiK, Scribe, Edge). Record peak memory,
temperature, battery drop and the latency line `score.mjs --pred` prints (p50, p95, max).
Pass: no crash, no thermal shutdown, p95 within the 1,200 ms deadline after the cold load.

## 4b. On-device speech (A1.2, flag `smd_speech_ondevice`)
Build with this branch (the speech plugin changed on both platforms; Android compiles, Swift untested).
On each phone, with the flag ON (`localStorage.setItem("smd_speech_ondevice","1")` over CDP):
1. `await SMD_NATIVE.speechOnDevice("en-IN")` and `("en-US")`: record `onDevice` per language and phone
   (Android needs 12+ and an installed on-device model; iOS depends on the language).
2. OPD field dictation (a noCloud caller): with on-device available the strip label reads "On-device";
   in Airplane mode it must still transcribe. On a phone without it, the doctor sees "This phone can't
   recognise speech without sending the audio off the device..." and nothing is sent.
3. MaiK Scribe Fast mode (prefer): the label reads "On-device" or "Device speech (cloud)", matching
   `SMD_NATIVE.lastSpeechMode`.
Pass: no noCloud session ever runs a cloud recognizer; labels match reality on both phones.

## 5. Training
**Needle on the Cactus platform** (synthetic data only; commands from `cactus-needle` 3.0.6 `llms.txt`):
```sh
pip install cactus-needle
export NEEDLE_API_KEY=...            # dashboard; never commit or paste it anywhere
cd vault/plans/edge-data/dataset/export/cactus
needle platform finetune train.jsonl validation.jsonl test.jsonl --suffix smd-router --out ./models
```
4,214 train rows (limit 100 to 10,000). Platform training keeps the confidence head calibrated;
a local LoRA (`needle finetune`) does not, so its builds run with `--uncalibrated`.
Download every depth; the bake-off picks the smallest one that passes.

**FunctionGemma on a rented GPU:** supervised fine-tune on `export/llama-json/train.jsonl`
(validation for early stopping), after step 3.4 settled the template. Then GGUF + Q8_0/Q4_K_M as in
step 3.5. Record the base model id, the trainer and its version, and the hyperparameters in this file.

## 6. Bake-off (day 5)
For each candidate (Needle depth N, FunctionGemma Q8_0, FunctionGemma Q4_K_M), on the 4 GB phone:
```sh
node test/edge-bakeoff-device.mjs --engine needle --weights <device path to tuned.cact>
node test/edge-bakeoff-device.mjs --engine llama --model <device path to .gguf>    # relaunch app after
node scripts/edge/score.mjs --pred edge-bakeoff-needle-android.jsonl --json needle.json
```
Human set: put the 150 typed requests in `vault/plans/edge-data/owner-requests.txt` (one per line,
no patient data), `node scripts/edge/score.mjs --draft vault/plans/edge-data/owner-requests.txt`,
fill the empty label column (`calculator:<id>`, `tool:<id>`, `drug:<generic>`, `icd`, `kb:<id>`,
`none`), then `node scripts/edge/score.mjs --human vault/plans/edge-data/owner-requests.labels.tsv`.

**Decision (plan 7.5):** a model ships only if it beats the **rules** line at the same marks:
accepted-route accuracy at least 99%, wrong tool shown under 0.5%, danger 100%, 0 dead ends, AND a
real gain (today rules cover 56.4%; Hinglish/Tenglish 0%; the ceiling with these options is 88.3%).
If no candidate clears it, Edge stays rules-only and the flag stays OFF.

## 7. Doctor review (owner + 2 doctors)
Each reviewer reads every row of `errors` in the winning model's `--json` report (wrong opens and,
with `--errors`, misses) plus the human-set errors, and marks each: harmless / needs a fix / unsafe.
Any "unsafe" blocks release. Log names, date and verdict in [[Decisions]].
