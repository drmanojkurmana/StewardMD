# Decisions

Dated architectural calls + why. Newest first. Keep each short: **decision · why · trade-off · status**.

## 2026-07-30 · Block internal source/docs from public serving
Pages serves the repo root, so `docs/` (runbook) + `CLAUDE.md` were publicly reachable (leaking team ID, SHA fingerprints, the inert-gate-key note). `functions/_middleware.js` now 404s internal paths (`docs/`, `vault/`, `ios/`, `*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`…). **Trade-off**: none for the app (only web assets are served). **Status**: live. Protects [[Home|this vault]] too.

## 2026-07-30 · On-demand native assets (fetch from stewardmd.in)
Heavy, flag-gated module assets are stripped from the native bundle and fetched on first use, cached by the WebView. First: [[FundX]] MediaPipe (~22 MB). **Why**: shrink install. **Trade-off**: one-time download on first module use (fallback: LOCAL→SELF→CDN, so nothing breaks). **Status**: phase 1 live (AAB 124→115 MB); ONNX / Learn / ML-Kit / offline-KB pending — see [[Roadmap]].

## 2026-07-30 · Vision/OCR pinned to a strong fixed model
[[Scan-Meds and Drug Index]] `/vision` used the global model → an admin model-override to `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` degraded handwriting OCR. Now `VISION_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`), ignoring the text override + emergency-cheap. **Why**: misreading a drug is a safety risk. **Status**: live.

## 2026-07-30 · Admin access = exactly 3 owner accounts
`drmanojkurmana@` / `mkkmanojkumar0@` / `kdiwakar45@gmail.com`; removed `stewardmd.in@`. Set in ALL gates (server `_adminauth.js` + `verifications`, client `home.js`/`sidebar-redesign.js`) + env `OWNER_EMAILS`. Server (Firebase id-token email) is the real boundary; client lists = UI visibility. **Status**: live.

## 2026-07-29 · Intent Firewall = allow-list, not block-list
See [[MaiK Intent Firewall]]. Require a positive medical signal; reject the rest. **Why**: a block-list can't enumerate all non-medical topics. **Invariant**: zero false-refusals. **Status**: live (gold1041).

## Standing principles
- **Reversible changes**: big/risky changes go behind a feature **flag** + a git **recovery point** (tag/branch); made permanent only after owner approval.
- **Test before you build** (owner mandate): unit + a real headless-browser test before shipping UI/logic.
- **No em-dash** in app-facing text (MaiK AI *output* exempt).
- **Mobile-only**: the web code IS the app (Capacitor renders local `www/`).
